# TBRU
This is an interactive shiny app for showing the data and analysis of TBRU project in Emory University. Since the project is new, the raw dataset is not complete and will be updated after. My goal is to learn data visualization and make a beautiful interactive UI.

To learn this shiny app, just:   </br>
1. make sure you have installed shiny package.  
2. run the code below:
       library(shiny)
       runGitHub("HoracceFeng/TBRU")
       
This side project may be updated later, but still not sure.       
Thanks for watching. Any comment is welcome.
